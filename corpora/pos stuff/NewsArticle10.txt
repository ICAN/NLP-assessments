“This is our home,” she said Tuesday, standing in her driveway wearing a sleeveless blouse and open-toed sandals. “Until it’s in my backyard and that rubber is melting on my truck I’m not going anywhere. We’ve got to protect the neighborhood. Who else is going to?” The flames came close to this neighborhood on the fire's northern edge Monday night. A wind shift pushed flames from the next road south -- West Sockeye Avenue, near where the fire started -- and toward the rural West Sheep Creek Drive neighborhood where Walz lives, amid a thick canopy of the same black spruce that this fire blows through like standing tinder. Alaska State Troopers told the scattered residents along the gravel road to evacuate. Walz lost her home in the 1996 Miller's Reach fire that destroyed more than 400. “I told him I wasn’t leaving,” she said. “They said it was voluntary anyway.” This fire, however, is expected to turn ugly again. Forecasts called for extreme behavior Tuesday night due to thunderstorms and erratic winds. The crews fighting the fire acknowledge the state's general policy against mandatory evacuations. But they don't like it, officials say, because homeowners may misjudge the danger. “The troopers are very cautious in advising us that evacuations are voluntary,” Tom Kurth, incident commander on the fire, said during a press conference Tuesday.
