Real world networks are often largeâ€” there are tens of thousands of human genes and trillions of connections in the human brain. Such scales make human visual processing of and decision making with the whole network prohibitive. This paper investigates algorithms to identify provably good approximations of the network topology, which capture important system dynamics while significantly reducing the number of edges to enable tractable analysis. 1 arXiv:1506.04767v1 [cs.IT] 15 Jun 2015 Quinn, Pinar, and Kiyavash Across different domains, edges are used to model various kinds of ties such as physical connections or dynamic relationships. For instance, in depicting a computer network, an edge might correspond to a physical wire or a packet exchange between a sender and a receiver. For the human brain, edges could correspond to information flow between different cells or brain regions (Takahashi et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2014). For online social networks, edges might represent user-defined relationships or pairs of users that frequently message each other (Ver Steeg and Galstyan, 2012, 2013). Edges that represent dynamics often must be inferred from activity, in some cases statistically. There is a large literature on graphs whose edges depict statistical relationships. Markov and Bayesian networks are well-known probabilistic graphical models whose edges represent correlation. Many methods have been proposed to infer and approximate the networks from i.i.d. data, often relying on heuristics.
