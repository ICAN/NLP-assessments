We propose algorithms to approximate directed information graphs. Directed information graphs are probabilistic graphical models that depict causal dependencies between stochastic processes in a network. The proposed algorithms identify optimal and near-optimal approximations in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence. The user-chosen sparsity trades off the quality of the approximation against visual conciseness and computational tractability. One class of approximations contains graphs with specified in-degrees. Another class additionally requires that the graph is connected. For both classes, we propose algorithms to identify the optimal approximations and also near-optimal approximations, using a novel relaxation of submodularity. We also propose algorithms to identify the r-best approximations among these classes, enabling robust decision making. Keywords: probabilistic graphical models, network inference, causality, submodularity, approximation algorithms 1. Introduction Many fields of the sciences and engineering require analysis, modeling, and decision making using networks, typically represented by graphs. Social networks, financial networks, and biological networks are a few categories that are relevant not only academically but also in daily life. A major challenge for studying networks is identifying a concise topology, such as who strongly influences whom in a social network. Real world networks are often large— there are tens of thousands of human genes and trillions of connections in the human brain.
