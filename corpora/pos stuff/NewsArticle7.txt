“If you’re not willing to go outside the parameters set by conglomerates, that safety net of success, there’s no point venturing out on your own,” Lee assures.

“Many young entrepreneurs seem to be jumping on the bandwagon, approaching the startup game for the wrong reasons, without any clear strategy in mind,” Lee notes. “If you’re not hungry enough, if you’re not ready to startup a new company, then it’s better to jump ship.”

President Park Geun-hye has vowed to cut through red tap and provide financial incentive for entrepreneurs, earmarking $92 billion to support small and mid-sized businesses, which also encompasses startups.

But getting startups off the ground is one thing, turning them into sustainable businesses is another. It seems only a matter of time before such inflated expectations burst, if entrepreneurs don’t keep at it for the right reasons.

Another obstacle for many entrepreneurs is the apparent lack of corporate culture that actively embraces M&A deals, which, in turn, rewards founders with attractive valuations. According to Go Young-ha, chairman of The Korean Business Angels Association, the government remains slow at harnessing the potential of younger entrepreneurs, many of whom are still under the spell of larger conglomerates that hold a monopoly on the country’s tech industries.
