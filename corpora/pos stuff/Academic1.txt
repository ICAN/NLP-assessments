Recently the proof of factorization in heavy quarkonium production in NRQCD color octet mechanism is given at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in coupling constant by using diagrammatic method of QCD. In this paper we prove factorization in heavy quarkonium production in NRQCD color octet mechanism at all order in coupling constant by using path integral method of QCD. Our proof is valid to all powers in the heavy quark relative velocity. We find that the gauge invariance and the factorization at all order in coupling constant require gauge-completed non-perturbative NRQCD matrix elements that were introduced previously to prove factorization at NNLO. INTRODUCTION In the last two decades, the NRQCD color octet mechanism [1] for heavy quarkonium production has been very successful in explaining experimental data at high energy colliders such as at Tevatron [2] and at LHC [3]. In its original formulation [1] the proof of factorization in heavy quarkonium production in NRQCD color octet mechanism was lacking. The proof of factorization is an essential requirement to study heavy quarkonium production at high energy colliders. Factorization refers to separation of short-distance effects from long-distance effects in quantum field theory.
