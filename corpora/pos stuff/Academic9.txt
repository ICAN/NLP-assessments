We propose a new gradient-domain technique for processing registered EM image stacks to remove inter-image discontinuities while preserving intra-image detail. To this end, we process the image stack by first performing anisotropic smoothing along the slice axis and then solving a Poisson equation within each slice to re-introduce the detail. The final image stack is continuous across the slice axis and maintains sharp details within each slice. Adapting existing out-of-core techniques for solving the linear system, we describe a parallel algorithm with time complexity that is linear in the size of the data and space complexity that is sub-linear, allowing us to process datasets as large as five teravoxels with a 600 MB memory footprint.

INTRODUCTION Recent innovation and automation of electron microscopy sectioning has made it possible to obtain high-resolution image stacks capturing the relationships between cellular structures [1]. This, in turn, has motivated research in areas such as connectomics [2], [3], [4], [5] which aims to gain insight into neural function through the study of the connectivity network. While the technological advances in acquisition and registration have made it possible to acquire unprecedentedly large micron-resolution volumes, the acquisition process itself introduces undesirable artifacts in the data, complicating tasks of (semi-)automatic anatomy tracking.
