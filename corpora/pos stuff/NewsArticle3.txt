In a day of protests in Egypt, hundreds of thousands of people marched in the streets on January 25th facing down riot police, water cannons, baton charges and tear gas. The people are chanting for freedom and an end to the corrupt administration of Hosni Mubarak, who has been in power for 30 years, with the demand that he join the Tunisian dictator Ben Ali in Saudi Arabia.   By mid-afternoon, the Egyptian government had blocked Twitter, websites of independent newspapers and live streaming application #bambuser. There are reports that phone lines used by lawyers and activists providing support are also being suspended, and many phone lines have had data services disabled.   At least six protesters were killed with some reports that police in some cities used live ammunition on crowds. Over 1000 protesters have been arrested and Egyptian telecoms are attempting to block access to sites where protesters can post coverage.   While few people will openly admit to liking the dictatorship of Mubarak, he is one of the largest recipients of US aid and maintains his power largely because of the US backing. . In a January 27th PBS interview, Vice President Biden said he would not refer to Egyptian President Mubarak as a dictator and instead called him an “ally” on a number of key foreign policy issues.
