We propose a simple mean-field ansatz to study phase transitions from a topological phase to a trivial phase. We probe the efficiency of this approach by considering the string-net model in the presence of a string tension for any anyon theory. Such a perturbation is known to be responsible for a deconfinement-confinement phase transition which is well described by the present variational setup. We argue that mean-field results become exact in the limit of large total quantum dimension. PACS numbers: 05.30.Pr, 05.30.Rt, 71.10.Pm, 75.10.Jm The blend of quantum computation and of topological phases of matter [1] have led to the idea of topological quantum computation [2–4]. In this field, the essential ingredient is the construction of physical systems sustaining exotic excitations known as non-Abelian anyons (see Ref. [5] for a review). Being genuinely non local, these anyons allow for efficient storage and manipulation of quantum information. Indeed, topologically ordered systems [1] are stable under local perturbations [6] and hence protected against undesirable effects such as decoherence. However, strong enough perturbations, may drive the system to a non topological phase. In recent years, many works have been devoted to the study of this robustness in microscopic models.
