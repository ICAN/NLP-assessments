Recently the proof of factorization in heavy quarkonium production in NRQCD color octet mechanism is given at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in coupling constant by using diagrammatic method of QCD. In this paper we prove factorization in heavy quarkonium production in NRQCD color octet mechanism at all order in coupling constant by using path integral method of QCD. Our proof is valid to all powers in the heavy quark relative velocity. We find that the gauge invariance and the factorization at all order in coupling constant require gauge-completed non-perturbative NRQCD matrix elements that were introduced previously to prove factorization at NNLO. INTRODUCTION In the last two decades, the NRQCD color octet mechanism [1] for heavy quarkonium production has been very successful in explaining experimental data at high energy colliders such as at Tevatron [2] and at LHC [3]. In its original formulation [1] the proof of factorization in heavy quarkonium production in NRQCD color octet mechanism was lacking. The proof of factorization is an essential requirement to study heavy quarkonium production at high energy colliders. Factorization refers to separation of short-distance effects from long-distance effects in quantum field theory. Recently the proof of factorization in heavy quarkonium production in NRQCD color octet mechanism is given at next-to-next to leading order (NLLO) in coupling constant by using diagrammatic method of QCD [4]. However, the proof of factorization in heavy quarkonium production in NRQCD color octet mechanism at all order in coupling constant is still missing. In this paper we will prove factorization in heavy quarkonium production in NRQCD color octet mechanism at all order in coupling constant by using path integral method of QCD. The typical non-perturbative NRQCD matrix element in heavy quarkonium production is given by [1] < On >=< χ† (0)Knξ(0)(a † HaH )ξ † (0)K′ nχ(0) > (1) where ξ is the two component Dirac spinor field that annihilates a heavy quark, χ is the two component Dirac spinor field that creates a heavy quark, a † H is the operator that creates the heavy quarkonium H in the out state. The factors Kn and K′ n are products of a color matrix (either a unit matrix or T a ), a spin matrix (either a unit matrix or σ i ) and a polynomial of covariant derivative D. The color and spin indices on the fields χ and ξ have been suppressed. The production cross section for heavy quarkonium H at transverse momentum PT in NRQCD factorizes into a sum of perturbative functions times universal matrix elements, dσA+B→H+X(PT ) = X n dσˆA+B→QQ¯[n]+X(PT ) < On > (2) where each NRQCD non-perturbative matrix element < On > represents the probability of a heavy quark-antiquark pair in state [n], such as color singlet or color octet etc., to produce heavy quarkonium state H. 2 The fragmentation function for parton i to evolve into a heavy quarkonium at large PT is factorized according to [5] DH/i(z, mc, µ) = X n di→QQ¯[n] (z, mc, µ) < On > (3) in terms of same NRQCD non-perturbative matrix elements, along with perturbative functions di→QQ¯[n] (z, mc, µ) that describe the evolution of an off-shell parton into a heavy quarkantiquark pair in state [n], such as color singlet or color octet etc.. At a first glance it can be easily seen that the non-perturbative NRQCD matrix element in eq. (1) is not gauge invariant unless it is a color singlet S-wave non-perturbative matrix element. Hence one expects that any non-canceling infrared divergences in the perturbative Feynman diagrams of heavy quark-antiquark production short-distance coefficient can not be factorized in to the definition of the non-perturbative NRQCD matrix element in eq. (1) to study heavy quarkonium production at high energy colliders in the NRQCD color octet mechanism. This is explicitly shown in [4] where the NNLO coupling constant calculation shows that the above non-perturbative NRQCD matrix element in eq. (1) is not consistent with factorization of infrared divergences unless it is a color singlet S-wave non-perturbative matrix element. By using the calculation at NNLO in coupling constant and to all powers in the heavy quark relative velocity it was shown in [4] that the octet S-wave non-perturbative NRQCD matrix element which is gauge invariant and is consistent with the factorization of infrared divergences is given by
